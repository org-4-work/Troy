Columbia Threadneedle Investment Funds (UK) ICVC \u2013 CT UK Smaller Companies Fund (the \u201cFund\u201d) is a sub-fund of Columbia Threadneedle Investment Funds (UK) ICVC, an investment company (i.e. a mutual fund) with variable capital constituted in England and Wales. The home regulator of Columbia Threadneedle Investment Funds (UK) ICVC is the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) in the UK. Objective and Investment Strategy   Investment Objective The Fund aims to achieve capital growth over the long term. It looks to outperform the Numis Smaller Companies Index ex Investment Companies over rolling 3-year periods, after the deduction of charges. Investment Policy The Fund is actively managed, and invests at least 90% of its assets in the shares of companies listed on the London Stock Exchange; predominantly smaller companies traded on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) or included within the Numis Smaller Companies Index ex Investment Companies, that are UK domiciled, or have significant UK business operations. The Fund selects companies considered to have good prospects for share price growth, from any industry or economic sector, with smaller companies providing potential exposure to niche growth areas that often cannot be accessed by large companies.  The Fund typically invests in shares of fewer than 70 companies. The Fund may invest in other securities (including fixed interest securities) and collective investment schemes (including funds managed by Columbia Threadneedle companies), when deemed appropriate. The Fund may also hold money market instruments, deposits, cash and near cash.  The Fund is not permitted to invest in derivatives for investment purposes, but derivatives may be used with the aim of reducing risk or managing the Fund more efficiently.   The Numis Smaller Companies Index ex Investment Companies is a widely used benchmark for monitoring the performance of UK smaller companies. It consists of companies that make up the smallest 10% of the UK main listed market by value (excluding investment companies). It provides a suitable target benchmark against which Fund performance will be measured and evaluated over time.
